This is a joke site made to practice my nonexistent html and css knowledge.
Nothing here is true and dogs don't rule the world or the CIA.
Site available at [https://sprintz-dev.github.io/Dogs-rule-the-world/](url)
The site is foss but idk why you would want the files for it.
Anyways, I got Mistral working in ollama and then made it generate this story and thought it would be funny to publish a fake news site.
